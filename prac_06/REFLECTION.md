# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

My participation in the lecture helped me to pay attention and learn more in the class.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I believe more effort should be put into the self-study process.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am working with my friends on a task and will keep helping them comprehend the parts that are challenging. I am also making progress in the process of receiving support.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

There's never a review procedure when a code is created, therefore things like naming can occasionally be weird. Doing a review process instead of sending it right away would be preferable.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Learning several programming languages would be nice.
