# Practical 07

## Introduction
Welcome to my CP1404 Practicals repository. This repository contains the practical exercises and assignments I completed as part of the CP1404 subject.

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Using meaningful and consistent names for variables, functions, and classes makes the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Modular Design:** Breaking down the code into smaller, reusable functions and modules helps in managing complexity and enhances code reusability.
- **Code Comments and Documentation:** Writing clear comments and documentation helps others (and future you) understand the code's purpose and logic.
