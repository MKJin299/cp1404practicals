# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was generally off by about 20-30% at the beginning. I often underestimated the time required for testing.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My projections become increasingly accurate as the topic developed. Usually, I finished within 10% to 15% of the time I had projected. I discovered how to account for time for unforeseen problems and careful testing.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I discovered that software development requires the critical ability of estimating. It improved my time management and gave me a deeper understanding of how difficult certain activities can be. In order to get more realistic estimates, I also learnt to divide more difficult jobs into smaller, more manageable chunks.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned the value of developing understandable, well-documented code from having other people examine it. I gained knowledge of many methods to problem-solving and coding styles. It also assisted me in locating holes in my own coding procedures.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By going over other people's code, I was able to read and comprehend code more quickly. It introduced me to many ways to problem-solving and coding methods. I also gained knowledge on how to politely offer constructive criticism.


Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[PR#1](https://github.com/ron991/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

I had never seen someone else's code till this review. I gained from the experience by comparing my code to someone else's and observing the differences. I also looked for flaws and fixed the mistakes made by the other individual.

### Good Code Review 2

[PR#3](https://github.com/Sam-Butters/cp1404practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

A student pointed out that there appeared to be an issue with a certain section of the code. When I checked and learned about a specific aspect of the issue, I felt good.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would implement more group projects and real-world scenarios if I were in charge. Students would get better teamwork abilities and an understanding of how the principles relate to real-world scenarios as a result. In addition, I would incorporate more performance analysis and code optimization tasks.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Using clean code concepts consistently throughout my practicals was something I excelled at. I deepened my comprehension of the ideas by making care to produce clear, well-documented code and by taking the time to rework my code after finishing the basic criteria.
